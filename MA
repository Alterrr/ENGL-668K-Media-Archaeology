The Kaypro 4 was marketed as a "luggable" computer, since the whole device could be carried around like a suitcase. Historically praised for the high contrast screen and the fast 4 Mhz CPU, the Kaypro 4 was also relatively affordable. It came with a built-in modem and a bundle of software attractive to first-time buyers of a computer. When IBM compatible systems began to dominate the market, the Kaypro suffered from a lack of compatible software.

VECTREX

Released in 1982
Vector-based gaming console
Price in 1982: $199, adjusted for inflation: $470
Price in 2015: $300 - $1000

The Vectrex was a vector-based gaming console that retailed for a much lower price than contemporary home computers. Vector graphics allowed for simpler hardware, eliminating the need for extensive memory and RAM. As a downside, the vectrex could only display one-color outlines and games came with plastic screens to add some color. However, vector graphics enabled any resolution without aliasing, and so the display of the vectrex received many positive reviews. The market crash of 1983 put an end to the demand for consoles and the Vectrex.
